# biffin-front
Version 0.01 

This contains both the front and back-end services for Biffin,
a game project that is a mix of advance wars and risk

NB: Everything in here will be subject to change.

As of version 0.01, the game is pretty much inexistent, what exists is the editor intended to create maps for the game loop that will come after.
