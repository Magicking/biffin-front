Scaling:
- make game device responsive and scalable:
	- implement grid with rows and columns
	- place scaling in game config

Sprites:
- DONE make 32x64 sprites for mountains 
	-Reduce the mountain's width a little
- depth layer the tiles for nicer rendering: 
- Overhaul all army sprites to 32x64 sprites
- add bridges to roads.png
- have road remove tiles on objectLayer when a tile is put down. (if a road is put down on a mountain, clear the road.)
- have forests and mountains place grass under themselves when placed


UI:
- enable resizing of the window.
-Test rexUi plugins - CANCELLED

BUGS: 
-   FIXED: Strange behaviour with how sometimes dynamic editing functions and other times not depending on where itâ€™s located. Left of screen does not register.
	-Fixed by removing the marker.x, and marker.y from the callback on tiles and having dynamic editing only be called when a tile is put down.
	
- FIXED: Error in one of the bitmasking values for one of grass findings. 
	-Switched bitmask value 75 for the correct tile index.
